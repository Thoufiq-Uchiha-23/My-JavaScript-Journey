//Types of Dataypes Discussed below:
let name = "thoufiq"
let age = 20
let isLoggedIn = false
let state;


/* PRIMITIVE DATATYPES */
//number => 2 to power of 53
//bigint => similar to long int
//string => ""
//boolean => true/false
//undefined => the variable has been declared but not assigned, self-explanatory
//symbol => used to define which is unique and not, mostly used for components
//symbol type are immensely used in Figma Design tools, where we aren't aware of the internal details for now

/* DYNAMIC DATATYPES */
//now there are also other types which are dynamic in Nature

//OBJECT

//typeof is used to specify the data type which we're using, same as we use in Python
console.log(typeof "Thoufiq");// string type
console.log(typeof age); //number
console.log(typeof undefined); //undefined
console.log(typeof null); //its an object => this is a bad functionality or others say this is how it should be
